    "\n",
    "<a id='psu'></a>\n",
    "### Power Supply Unit (PSU)\n",
    "Each lab station is equipped with an Agilent E3631A power supply, located on the bottom shelf. You can think of this device as a controllable battery that allows you to specify its voltage and current outputs (more on voltage and current later). <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/supply.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:180px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief summary of the steps you should take each time you setup the power supply (after connecting it to your circuit). This is just a reference; you will get to use the Power Supply shortly:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <strong>Turn the PSU on.</strong>\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <strong>Set a current limit:</strong>\n",
    "This device allows you to limit the amount of current it outputs, which is very useful to prevent accidentally destroying parts when a circuit is connected incorrectly. The current is shown on the right of the display. To set a current limit, first push the \"Display Limit\" button. Next, push the \"Voltage/Current\" button on the right of the machine so that the current is selected (blinking). Then, use the arrow buttons on the right to select the digit you want to adjust, and then use the knob to adjust the value of that digit. Generally, we will use $0.100A$ unless otherwise noted. Do this for all used output voltages (see step 3 for selecting outputs), and then exit the limit mode by pushing \"Display Limit\" again (so that the actual current draw, *not* the limit is displayed). **<span style=\"color:red\">$0.100A$ might seem like a small amount; however, it is still enough to cause serious damage to the circuit components and microcontroller.</span>**\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <strong>Select an output:</strong>\n",
    "This device is capable of outputting 3 different voltages with maximum values of $6V, 25V$, and $-25V$ respectively. Make sure to push the button for the output you would like to use.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <strong>Set the voltage:</strong>\n",
    "After selecting the correct output (step 3), set the voltage to the desired value. To do this, push the \"Voltage/Current\" button so that the voltage (displayed on the left) is selected (blinking). Then adjust the value using the arrow buttons and knob, like when you set the current limit. <strong>Make sure you are adjusting voltage and NOT current.</strong>\n",
    "<br/><br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "5. <strong>Turn the output on:</strong>\n",
    "By default, the output of the device is turned off. For the device to actually output current, press the \"Output On/Off\" button. <strong> Always turn the output OFF whenever you are idle / don't need the Power Supply!</strong>\n",

    "### Oscilloscope\n",
    "The oscilloscope is another useful piece of test equipment that can be used to measure signals that change over time. Unlike a voltmeter, which only shows the instantaneous voltage value, the oscilloscope shows a graph of a voltage versus time. This is particularly useful for measuring how devices like sensors respond to inputs. Although this instrument may appear complicated, half of the knobs are just to adjust the axes of the voltage plot.\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/scope.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:200px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "Below is a brief overview of how to use the oscilloscope at your lab station when testing a hypothetical circuit:\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "$1.$ <strong>Obtain an Oscilloscope Probe:</strong>\n",
    "Grab an oscilloscope probe from the back wall. Probes are gray and have two connectors at one of the ends: The gray connector is a spring-loaded clip (pull back to expose the clip), and the other connector is a black alligator clip.<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/osc-probe.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:150px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your probe might be missing the gray shell on the spring loaded clip, but that's okay. When the gray shell is missing, the connector will look something like:<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/osc-probe-no-hook.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:150px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "$2.$ <strong>Test the Probe:</strong>\n",
    "Turn the oscilloscope on (button at the bottom left corner). Connect the probe to one of the 4 input channels (yellow, green, blue, or red). Make sure that the channel is on (indicated by a green light on the channel number). To turn a channel on (when it was originally off), simply press the corresponding numbered button. To turn it off, push the button again, and the light will be off. To test the probe, first locate the 3 metal testing tabs to the left of the 1st input channel (pictured below). Connect the black alligator clip of the probe to the middle (horizontal) tab. Connect the spring loaded clip end (or just the probe tip if your probe lacks a shell) to the left-most tab (vertical). With the probe connected, hit the \"Auto Scale\" button at the top right (pictured below). If your output is a square wave (pictured below), then your probe is working. If your output is not a square wave, tell your GSI immediately and get a new probe.<br/><br/>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/oscope_test.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:200px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$3.$ <strong>Connect your probe to your circuit.</strong>\n",
    "Again, this is a hypothetical circuit.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$4.$ <strong>Auto Scale:</strong>\n",
    "Potentially skip steps 5-7 by using the \"Auto Scale\" button (see the image above) to automatically scale the axes. **Don't get too dependent on the \"Auto Scale\" button; sometimes it doesn't do a \"good enough\" job.**\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$5.$ <strong>Adjust the horizontal axis of the plot.</strong>\n",
    "The large knob at the top (immediately to the right of the screen) controls the horizontal time axis and allows you to zoom in or out. The time increments represented by the tick marks on the plot are indicated at the top of the screen.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$6.$ <strong>Adjust the vertical scale.</strong>\n",
    "The larger of the two knobs for each channel (the one above the button with the channel number) allows the vertical scale of the voltage graph to be adjusted. As with the horizontal scale, the number of volts per tick mark on the graph is marked at the top of the screen.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$7.$ <strong>Adjust the offset.</strong>\n",
    "In some cases, signals will appear off screen; adjusting the smaller of the two knobs (below the channel number button) corresponding to each input will shift signals up or down on the plot. Hitting the `Autoscale` button near the top right of the Oscope will most likely be used until you get used to manually adjusting the view.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab in the imaging module! The goal of this module is to build the imaging system introduced in class. The physical components of this system include a pico projector, ambient light sensor, some passive electronics, and a [TI MSP430 Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html?DCMP=rtos&HQS=ep-sdo-rtos-pr-lp-launchpad-en) microcontroller. The completed setup of the imaging system is shown below. \n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/old_setup.jpg\" style=\"width:550px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be using the projector or stand today; this is the setup you will be building next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='overview'></a>\n",
    "### System Overview\n",
    "The following figure shows a high-level block model of our imaging system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the system flow: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ambient light sensor converts light energy into electrical current; more ambient light leads to more current. \n",
    "2. The current produced by the ambient light sensor then travels through passive electrical components. This translates the current into a detectable signal (a voltage signal). \n",
    "3. The TI Launchpad reads this signal, digitizes it, and sends it to the PC. \n",
    "4. The digitized signal gets converted into an image by some linear algebra code written in your iPython (Jupyter) notebook. Further improvements are made via software to increase the quality of the image.\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/system_diagram.svg\" style=\"height:256px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images are composed of a grid of [pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), each of which represents a single color. To create a digital representation, optical imaging systems measure the energy, equivalent to light in this case, reflected off of objects to determine the values of these pixels. Because different colors reflect different amounts of light, measurements of reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between colors.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/overview.svg\" style=\"height:256px\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial cameras, such as those found in smartphones, use chips called CMOS image sensors to measure millions of pixel values at a time (think of this as millions of devices akin to the ambient light sensor that all fit on an approximately 30mm$^2$ chip). In contrast, our system can only measure one light intensity value at a time, so we will instead use a controlled energy source, the projector, to illuminate specific regions of the image. We then use the ambient light sensor to record the energy that reflects off of those regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ambient light sensor converts light to induce a flow of electrons. The circuit then outputs a voltage that changes in real time, depending on the light intensity. The voltage can be thought of as a real \"analog\" value, serving as a starting point for being able to represent our image on a computer. We use a microcontroller (Launchpad) to take samples of the voltage signal and convert them to a set of digital numbers that we can then use in our Jupyter (iPython) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='review'></a>\n",
    "### Circuit Symbols and Concepts\n",
    "The figure below shows the circuit symbols relevant to this lab and a picture of the real components they represent. Don't feel intimidated if you don't know what these things are. **At this point in the course, you are NOT expected to know what these components are or what they are supposed to do.** You will eventually master these components during the circuits part of 16A. But if you're curious and need to know now, Wikipedia is your friend in this case.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/circuit-symbols.svg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:256px\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "A voltage is defined as a difference in electric potential between two points. For example, the voltage source we will be using in this lab has a potential difference of $+3.3V$ between its positive and negative terminals. Because a voltage must be defined across two points, it is often convenient to define a common point in a circuit as a reference. This reference voltage, commonly referred to as \"ground\" (GND), is defined by convention to be $0V$, and therefore allows us to conveniently describe voltages at any point in the circuit with respect to $0V$.

    "The MSP430 Launchpad is a popular [microcontroller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) -- a small computer on a single chip. Microcontrollers are found at the heart of all embedded devices and have enough processing power to perform simple tasks using very little power. Because of its limited processing capabilities, the Launchpad does not run an operating system like desktop computers or servers. Instead, the device executes a single function continuously in a loop when it is powered on. For this module, our program needs to read a voltage value and send it to a computer via the USB connection. We will now walk through the process of using a Launchpad and uploading code to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The Launchpad is produced by Texas Instruments and comes in many flavors. The model we will be using throughout the semester is the MSP430F5529. This is the model number you will want to reference whenever prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "$1.$ Use the USB cable (included in the Launchpad box) to connect the Launchpad to your computer. Verify that the green LED near the USB port on the Launchpad lights up once it's connected to the computer.\n",

    "$2.$ Open **Energia** on your desktop (there should be a desktop icon that looks like a rocket ship on a red circular backdrop -- see the top-left icon in the image below). Energia is a software program used to compile and upload code to the microcontroller. If you have ever programmed an Arduino, you will notice the environment is nearly identical.\n",

    "$4.$ In Energia, select the right serial port via **\"Tools > Port > COM#\"**. For this lab module, we will use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication\">serial interface</a> to transmit data back-and-forth between the Launchpad and the computer. In order to upload code to the device, we have to select the serial port that the Launchpad is connected to. On the lab computers, there should be three options, \"COM1\" and then two others. Use the **Windows Device Manager** to figure out which COM port is connected to **UART1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any time you are unable to upload code or communicate with the Launchpad, use this menu to check if the port is still recognized. If no options appear in this menu, try unplugging the Launchpad and plugging it back in.\n",

    "\n",
    "$5.$ Open (**File > Open**) the file \"LightSensor.ino\" (included in the lab zip file). The Launchpad requires that the \".ino\" source file be placed in a folder with the same name; e.x. LightSensor.ino should be found in **`..../LightSensor/LightSensor.ino`**. This file has code to periodically read the voltage of the Launchpad's pin **`P6.0`** and send this data over a serial interface called UART to a computer. UART is a type of communication protocol. It is important to note that only **ONE** instance of serial communication can be open per device. *This means that if you try to communicate with your MSP through the serial monitor in Energia, you will not be able to communicate with it through Command Prompt.*\n",
    "\n",
    "$6.$ Click the **\"Upload\"** button (white circle with a right-pointing arrow, as shown below). This should compile and upload code to the Launchpad. You  might get an error message prompting you to \"Update the Programmer.\" To resolve this issue simply go to \"Tools > Update Programmer\", then re-upload the desired code file. Once the \"Done uploading.\" message is displayed, the Launchpad will repeatedly execute the code whenever it is powered on. Even though the programming \"Success\" message is displayed, it is good practice to reset the Launchpad <em>EVERY TIME</em> you upload to it. To do this, press one of the four black pushbuttons labeled **\"RST\"** found on the front side of the MSP (see the image in step 7 below). Unplugging and replugging the MSP has the same effect.\n",

    "$7.$ Connect the Launchpad to the sensor circuit (see figures below). Our goal is to use the Launchpad to replace both the Power Supply and Oscilloscope. The Launchpad is capable of supplying the $3.3V$ necessary to power the circuit and can also read and send voltage values to our computer via Input / Output pins. Something to keep in mind that gives you flexibility in the future: the Launchpad has both Male and Female connections (Male on the front side, Female on the back).

If you are getting only single digit numbers, make sure your sensor is plugged in the correct orientation.
